## Who are OnBuy?
Since being awarded as the 'eCommerce Company of the Year' at the 2020 UK Business Tech Awards, we have gone on to raise Â£35 million in a Series A+ funding round and have quickly become recognised as being one of the fastest-growing eCommerce companies in the world. 
We are on a mission to provide â€˜the most transparent and fair-trading platformâ€™ for sellers, and a place where buyers can easily find what they need, every day. What sets OnBuy apart from other marketplaces is that we donâ€™t compete with our sellers, we donâ€™t sell our own products and we donâ€™t have our own warehouses, which creates a more efficient business model that allows us to focus on the customer experience and helps us to reinforce trust in our sellers, and the platform itself.
